## Introduction

This repository provides a robust implementation of a Doubly Linked List in Java. A Doubly Linked List is a versatile data structure where each element, known as a node, contains data and two pointers - one to the next node and one to the previous node.

## Features

- **Basic Operations:**
  - Add elements at the beginning (`add_first`)
  - Add elements at the end (`add_last`)
  - Remove elements from the beginning (`remove_first`)
  - Remove elements from the end (`remove_last`)
  - Add elements at any position (`add_any`)
  - Remove elements from any position (`remove_any`)
  - Reverse the linked list (`reverse`)
  - Search for a specific node (`search_node`)
- **Size and Empty Checks:**
  - Get the size of the list (`get_size`)
  - Check if the list is empty (`is_empty`)
- **Print Elements:**
  - Display the elements of the list in forward and backward directions (`print_forward`, `print_backward`)
